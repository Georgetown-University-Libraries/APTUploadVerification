# Georgetown's Preservation Workflow Strategy for Academic Preservation Trust

This presentation describes the systems that the Georgetown University Library built to ingest content into the [Academic Preservation Trust](http://aptrust.org/) system.  
This material was presented as a webinar to the Academic Preservation Trust Bagging Interest Group on Sep 28, 2017.
The tools described in this presentation were developed in 2016.  Using these tools from Sep 2016-Sep 2017, the Georgetown University Library processed the majority of it's backlog of digital files requiring preservation.  The workflows described in this presentation will support the preservation of future digital assets.
